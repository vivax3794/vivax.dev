# "Compiler Part 4 - Operators"

In the last post we implemented the `==` operator, and we just did a very simple implementation, but today we will start adding more fun operators.

And as always you can find the code [here](https://github.com/vivax3794/viv_script_blog/tree/4b389ee1cb3f0d8ad46313f51749c05b9ae89bbe)

### What Operators will we add?

We will add the classic math operators for ints, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and we will also add the `!` operator for bools, in addition to `&&` and `||`. We will also add the comparison operators, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.

### Prefix Operators

Now a little note on prefix operators, it might be clear that `!` is a operator. but what about stuff like `-`? well it is a prefix and infix operator, so we are going to parse `-5` as `Prefix(Neg, Literal(5))`, why not `Literal(-5)`? To make it easy ofc! We will use the same parsing logic for `-5`, but also `-x`, `-(1 + 2)` etc. (and yes we will be adding parentheses as well!)

### Precedence

This is basically order of operations, so `1 + 2 * 3` is parsed as `1 + (2 * 3)`, and not `(1 + 2) * 3`. First lets define some terms, "lower" precedence means that the operator is evaluated first, so `*` has lower precedence than `+`, and "higher" precedence means that the operator is evaluated last, so `+` has higher precedence than `*`.

A nice way of thinking about this in terms of parsing is glue, `*` glues together stuff and then `+` goes, like `1 + 2*3`. But this isnt just for operators, but expressions as a whole. 

so in the big picture it goes: Operator > Function call > Parentheses > Literals.
You might assume that prefix operators have a lower precedence than binary operators, but that is not the case. for example `-1 + 2` is parsed as `(-1) + 2`, so `-` (prefix) has a lower precedence than `+` (binary). But on the other hand `!x == y` is parsed as `!(x == y)` so `!` (prefix) has a higher precedence than `==` (binary).

Also multiple operators can have the same precedence, like `+` and `-`, but in that case we just read right to left! 

This is gonna be a bit of a challenge, but we will get through it! Parsing prefix is pretty easy, but binary is where it gets annoying. 

### Associativity

So you might assume we will do something like: 
```rust
let left_side = parse_expression(precedence - 1);
let operator = {Â ... };
let right_side = parse_expression(precedence);
return Binary(left_side, operator, right_side);
```
So this will parse `1 + 2 + 3` as `1 + (2 + 3)`, all fine right? but what about `-`? `1 - 2 - 3` would be parsed as `1 - (2 - 3)`, but that isnt right, it should got right to left! This is a bit annoying to parse, you might be trying to think of how to do this, and the trick is **dont** use recursion! We will use a loop instead, it will look something like: 
```rust
let mut left_side = parse_expression(precedence - 1);
while current_token_is_binary_operator_with_precedence(precedence) {
    let operator = { ... };
    let right_side = parse_expression(precedence - 1);
    left_side = Binary(left_side, operator, right_side);
}
```
> Note: this is just pseudo code, it wont look like this exactly, but it is just to show the idea.

This will parse it and build up the `()` around the left side, so `1 - 2 - 3` is parsed as `(1 - 2) - 3` as it should.

Another thing we should consider is comparison chaining like `1 < 2 < 3`, this would be parsed as `1 < 2 && 2 < 3`, we could just convert this to the same IR as `1 < 2 && 2 < 3`, but that does run into an issue of calculating one side twice. imagine `1 == print("hello") == 2` (this code doesn't really make sense), but we dont want it to print twice! So we will add comparison chaining to the ir as well! 

## Parsing plan

So we are going to have a list of levels, with enums for the different types. but we will also hardcode some parts, like once we hit the end of the list we will call `parse_group` for example, because that is easiest!

## Prefix Operators

We are gonna start with the simple prefix operators, so `!` and `-`.
and as always we add a test:
```
# prefix.viv
${
    assert !false;
    assert !!true;
    assert --5 == 5;
}
```

### Parsing

So add the tokens for `!` and `-` (`Bang` and `Minus`)! Then we will modify the ast!
```rust
// parsing/ast.rs
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum Expression {
    Literal(Literal),
    BinaryOp(Box<Expression>, BinaryOp, Box<Expression>),
    Prefix(PrefixOp, Box<Expression>),
}

#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]
pub enum PrefixOp {
    Negate,
    Not,
}
```

Then comes the job of parsing this stuff! So remember how we made that `prefix` function in the last post that did nothing? well now we will make it do something! 

```rust
// parsing/parser.rs
enum OperatorType {
    Binary(Vec<(TokenType, ast::BinaryOp)>),
    Prefix(TokenType, ast::PrefixOp),
}
```
We will use this enum to handle precedence. So we will make a list of operators, and then we will loop through them and parse them. This list feels like it should be a const, or maybe static? But one issue... we cant use `Vec` in a static, we could just create a new instance on each call, but that is stupid. We could store the list on the Parser struct, which is not a bad idea, and you can totally go for that if you want. 

But we will use [`lazy_static!`](), which is a macro that lets us create a static that is lazily evaluated, so it is only evaluated once, and then it is stored. So we will create a static list of operators, and then we will loop through them and parse them. 

```rust
lazy_static! {
    static ref OPERATORS: Vec<OperatorType> = vec![
        OperatorType::Prefix(TokenType::Bang, ast::PrefixOp::Not),
        OperatorType::Prefix(TokenType::Minus, ast::PrefixOp::Negate),
    ];
}
```
Wether this is good code is up to you, personally this is a thing I like to have as a const/static, and `lazy_static!` is a nice way to do it.
And yes we do remove `==` for now, we will add it back later. This does mean that test we just added wont work, but by the end of the post the tests should be working again!

So that `prefix` method I added last post? yhe delete it!
```rust
    fn expression_precedence(&mut self, precedence: usize) -> anyhow::Result<ast::Expression> {
        let level = match OPERATORS.get(precedence) {
            Some(level) => level,
            None => return Ok(ast::Expression::Literal(self.literal()?)),
        };

        match level {
            OperatorType::Prefix(token, op) => {
                if self.peek()? == token {
                    self.0.void();
                    let expression = self.expression_precedence(precedence)?;
                    Ok(ast::Expression::Prefix(*op, Box::new(expression)))
                } else {
                    self.expression_precedence(precedence + 1)
                }
            }
            OperatorType::Binary(_) => todo!(),
        }
    }

    fn expression(&mut self) -> anyhow::Result<ast::Expression> {
        self.expression_precedence(0)
    }
```
The first part we get the operator level, and if we hit the end of the list we parse a literal (we will change this to `group` later). The prefix code is simple enough, we check if the operator is present, if it is we parse an expression with the same precedence (we allow chaining the same operator, so `!!true` is valid!)

### Ir

Now in the IR we will add a variant for the prefix actions directly, why? simple, there is only one for each type :P 
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum IntExpression {
    Literal(i32),
    Negate(Box<IntExpression>),
}

#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum BooleanExpression {
    Literal(bool),
    Not(Box<BooleanExpression>),
    Comparison(ComparisonExpression),
}
```

The type resolving code is fairly simple for this:
```rust
fn resolve_expression(expression: &ast::Expression) -> anyhow::Result<TypedExpression> {
    match expression {
        ast::Expression::Literal(literal) => resolve_literal(literal),
        ast::Expression::Prefix(op, expression) => {
            let expression = resolve_expression(expression)?;

            match op {
                ast::PrefixOp::Negate => {
                    let expression = expression.is_int()?;

                    Ok(TypedExpression::Int(ir::IntExpression::Negate(Box::new(
                        expression,
                    ))))
                }
                ast::PrefixOp::Not => {
                    let expression = expression.is_boolean()?;

                    Ok(TypedExpression::Boolean(ir::BooleanExpression::Not(
                        Box::new(expression),
                    )))
                }
            }
        }
        ast::Expression::BinaryOp(left, op, right) => { ... }
}
```
This function is starting to get a bit crowded, so lets do some refactoring shall we?
```rust
// type_analyzer.rs
fn resolve_prefix(
    expression: &Box<ast::Expression>,
    op: &ast::PrefixOp,
) -> anyhow::Result<TypedExpression> {
  // ..
}

fn resolve_binary(
    left: &Box<ast::Expression>,
    op: &ast::BinaryOp,
    right: &Box<ast::Expression>,
) -> anyhow::Result<TypedExpression> {
  // ...
}

fn resolve_expression(expression: &ast::Expression) -> anyhow::Result<TypedExpression> {
    match expression {
        ast::Expression::Literal(literal) => resolve_literal(literal),
        ast::Expression::Prefix(op, expression) => resolve_prefix(expression, op),
        ast::Expression::BinaryOp(left, op, right) => resolve_binary(left, op, right),
    }
}
```

### Code gen

Now code gen is pretty simple because of inkwell:
```rust
// code_gen.rs

    fn compile_int_expression(&self, expression: &ir::IntExpression) -> inkwell::values::IntValue {
        match expression {
            ir::IntExpression::Literal(int) => self.int_type().const_int(*int as u64, false),
            ir::IntExpression::Negate(expression) => {
                let expression = self.compile_int_expression(expression);
                self.builder.build_int_neg(expression, "Negate")
            }
        }
    }

    fn compile_bool_expression(
        &self,
        expression: &ir::BooleanExpression,
    ) -> inkwell::values::IntValue {
        match expression {
            ir::BooleanExpression::Literal(boolean) => {
                self.context.bool_type().const_int(*boolean as u64, false)
            }
            ir::BooleanExpression::Not(expression) => {
                let expression = self.compile_bool_expression(expression);
                self.builder.build_not(expression, "Not")
            }
            ir::BooleanExpression::Comparison(comparison) => self.compile_comparison(comparison),
        }
    }
```

Now running the tests wont work because of the missing `==` operator, but we will add that now!

## Comparisons

Now we have to deal with chaining! 
But first tests!
```
# comparisons.viv
${
    assert 1 == 1;
    assert 1 != 2;

    assert 0 < 2;
    assert -2 < 0;
    assert 1 <= 1;
    assert 1 <= 2;

    assert 1 == 1 == 1;
    assert 1 < 2 < 3;
    assert 1 < 2 <= 2;

    assert 1 > 0;
    assert 1 > 0 < 1;
}
```

### Parsing

so you should add tokens for `<`, `!=`, `==`, `<=`, `>=`, `>`!

Then we can modify the ast
```rust
// parsing/ast.rs
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum Expression {
    Literal(Literal),
    BinaryOp(Box<Expression>, BinaryOp, Box<Expression>),
    Prefix(PrefixOp, Box<Expression>),
    Comparison(Box<Expression>, Vec<(ComparisonOp, Expression)>),
}

#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]
pub enum ComparisonOp {
    Equals,
    NotEquals,
    LessThan,
    LessThanEquals,
    GreaterThan,
    GreaterThanEquals,
}

// Also remove `Equals` from the binary operators
```
Here we use a Vector to store the comparisons, so we can chain them. And you can chain multiple different ones if you want, like `2 == x < y` for example is `2 == x && x < y`. We will also need to add comparisons to our `OPERATORS` static!

```rust
// parsing/parser.rs
lazy_static! {
    static ref OPERATORS: Vec<OperatorType> = vec![
        OperatorType::Prefix(TokenType::Bang, ast::PrefixOp::Not),
        OperatorType::Comparison(vec![
            (TokenType::EqEq, ast::ComparisonOp::Equals),
            (TokenType::BangEq, ast::ComparisonOp::NotEquals),
            (TokenType::Lt, ast::ComparisonOp::LessThan),
            (TokenType::LtEq, ast::ComparisonOp::LessThanEquals),
            (TokenType::Gt, ast::ComparisonOp::GreaterThan),
            (TokenType::GtEq, ast::ComparisonOp::GreaterThanEquals)
        ]),
        OperatorType::Prefix(TokenType::Minus, ast::PrefixOp::Negate),
    ];
}
```
And yes a `HashMap` would be more efficient, but this is fine for now. If you have a performance issue you can change it later.
```rust
            OperatorType::Comparison(comparisons) => {
                let left_side = self.expression_precedence(precedence + 1)?;
                let mut chains = Vec::new();

                loop {
                    let token = self.peek()?;
                    if let Some((_, op)) = comparisons.iter().find(|(t, _)| t == token) {
                        self.0.void();
                        chains.push((*op, self.expression_precedence(precedence + 1)?));
                    } else {
                        break;
                    }
                }

                if chains.is_empty() {
                    Ok(left_side)
                } else {
                    Ok(ast::Expression::Comparison(Box::new(left_side), chains))
                }
            }
```
This code basically loops while there is still a comparison token, and then it creates the chain! 

### Ir 

We modify the IR in a similar way to the AST:
```rust
// ir.rs
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum ComparisonExpression {
    IntComparison(Box<IntExpression>, Vec<(IntComparisonOp, IntExpression)>),
}
```

And then the `IntComparisonsOp` is similar to the AST version.

And then we solve the types, for now you can delete the code in `resolve_binary` (chuck a `todo!()` in there!), then we will add an resolve comparison, for now we only got int comparisons, so that should be easy. 

```rust
fn resolve_comparison(
    left_side: &Box<ast::Expression>,
    chains: &Vec<(ast::ComparisonOp, ast::Expression)>,
) -> anyhow::Result<TypedExpression> {
    let left_side = resolve_expression(left_side)?;
    let left_side = left_side.is_int()?;
    let chains = chains
        .iter()
        .map(|(op, expression)| {
            let expression = resolve_expression(expression)?;
            let expression = expression.is_int()?;

            let op = match op {
                ast::ComparisonOp::Equals => ir::IntComparisonOp::Equal,
                ast::ComparisonOp::NotEquals => ir::IntComparisonOp::NotEquals,
                ast::ComparisonOp::LessThan => ir::IntComparisonOp::LessThan,
                ast::ComparisonOp::LessThanEquals => ir::IntComparisonOp::LessThanEquals,
                ast::ComparisonOp::GreaterThan => ir::IntComparisonOp::GreaterThan,
                ast::ComparisonOp::GreaterThanEquals => ir::IntComparisonOp::GreaterThanEquals,
            };

            Ok((op, expression))
        })
        .collect::<anyhow::Result<Vec<_>>>()?;

    Ok(TypedExpression::Boolean(ir::BooleanExpression::Comparison(
        ir::ComparisonExpression::IntComparison(Box::new(left_side), chains),
    )))
}

fn resolve_expression(expression: &ast::Expression) -> anyhow::Result<TypedExpression> {
    match expression {
        ast::Expression::Literal(literal) => resolve_literal(literal),
        ast::Expression::Prefix(op, expression) => resolve_prefix(expression, op),
        ast::Expression::BinaryOp(left, op, right) => resolve_binary(left, op, right),
        ast::Expression::Comparison(left_side, chains) => resolve_comparison(left_side, chains),
    }
}
```

### Code gen

Code gen is also pretty simple, we just need to add a new function for the comparison:
```rust
    fn compile_comparison(
        &self,
        comparison: &ir::ComparisonExpression,
    ) -> inkwell::values::IntValue {
        match comparison {
            ir::ComparisonExpression::IntComparison(left, chains) => {
                let mut current_left = self.compile_int_expression(left);
                let mut parts = Vec::with_capacity(chains.len() - 1);

                for (op, right_side) in chains {
                    let right_side = self.compile_int_expression(right_side);
                    let op = match op {
                        ir::IntComparisonOp::Equal => IntPredicate::EQ,
                        ir::IntComparisonOp::NotEquals => IntPredicate::NE,
                        ir::IntComparisonOp::LessThan => IntPredicate::SLT,
                        ir::IntComparisonOp::LessThanEquals => IntPredicate::SLE,
                        ir::IntComparisonOp::GreaterThan => IntPredicate::SGT,
                        ir::IntComparisonOp::GreaterThanEquals => IntPredicate::SGE,
                    };

                    let part =
                        self.builder
                            .build_int_compare(op, current_left, right_side, "Compare");

                    parts.push(part);
                    current_left = right_side;
                }

                let mut result = parts[0];
                for part in parts.iter().skip(1) {
                    result = self.builder.build_and(result, *part, "And");
                }

                result
            }
        }
    }
```
and ofc then use this in `compile_boolean_expression`!

So we basically loop over each pair of expressions, and then we compare them, and then we `and` them together. So `1 < 2 < 3` is compiled as `1 < 2 && 2 < 3`.

Running our tests we see them all work! But we still have to add the binary operators!

## Binary Operators - ints

So now integers, time to do some MATH! YAY!
And as always, tests!
```
${
    assert 1 + 1 == 2;
    assert 1 + 2 + 3 == 6;
    assert 2 * 3 + 4 == 10;
    assert 1 - 2 - 3 == -4; 
    
    # These are some strange edge cases!
    assert -5 + 2 == -3;
    assert -5 - 2 == -7;
    assert 5 + -3 == 2; 
    assert 3 - -2 == 5;
    assert 3 --- 2 == 1;
    assert 3 + 2 - 1 == 4;
    
    assert 4 * 6 / 2 == 12;
}
```

### Parsing

Okay so you need to add the `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` tokens to the tokenizer, and then the `Plus`, `Minus`, etc, to the AST. And then we need to add them to the `OPERATORS` static. 

```rust
// parsing/parser.rs
lazy_static! {
    static ref OPERATORS: Vec<OperatorType> = vec![
        OperatorType::Prefix(TokenType::Bang, ast::PrefixOp::Not),
        OperatorType::Comparison(vec![
            // ...
        ]),
        OperatorType::Binary(vec![
            (TokenType::Plus, ast::BinaryOp::Plus),
            (TokenType::Minus, ast::BinaryOp::Minus),
        ]),
        OperatorType::Binary(vec![
            (TokenType::Star, ast::BinaryOp::Multiply),
            (TokenType::Slash, ast::BinaryOp::Divide),
        ]),
        OperatorType::Prefix(TokenType::Minus, ast::PrefixOp::Negate),
    ];
}
```

Then we do our parsing logic!
```rust
            OperatorType::Binary(mappings) => {
                let mut left_side = self.expression_precedence(precedence + 1)?;
                loop {
                    let token = self.peek()?;
                    if let Some((_, op)) = mappings.iter().find(|(t, _)| t == token) {
                        self.0.void();
                        let right_side = self.expression_precedence(precedence + 1)?;
                        left_side = ast::Expression::BinaryOp(
                            Box::new(left_side),
                            *op,
                            Box::new(right_side),
                        );
                    } else {
                        break;
                    }
                }

                Ok(left_side)
            }
```
Here we build up the left side one operator at a time! 

### Ir 

The IR is simple to modify:
```rust
// ir.rs
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum IntExpression {
    Literal(i32),
    Negate(Box<IntExpression>),
    BinaryOperation(Box<IntExpression>, IntBinaryOp, Box<IntExpression>),
}

#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum IntBinaryOp {
    Plus,
    Minus,
    Multiply,
    Divide,
}
```

The type resolution is gonna be very similar to the comparison!
```rust
// type_analyzer.rs
fn resolve_binary(
    left: &Box<ast::Expression>,
    op: &ast::BinaryOp,
    right: &Box<ast::Expression>,
) -> anyhow::Result<TypedExpression> {
    let left = resolve_expression(left)?;
    let right = resolve_expression(right)?;

    match left {
        TypedExpression::Int(left) => {
            let right = right.is_int()?;
            let op = match op {
                ast::BinaryOp::Plus => ir::IntBinaryOp::Plus,
                ast::BinaryOp::Minus => ir::IntBinaryOp::Minus,
                ast::BinaryOp::Multiply => ir::IntBinaryOp::Multiply,
                ast::BinaryOp::Divide => ir::IntBinaryOp::Divide,
                _ => Err(TypeError("Operator not supported for int".to_string()))?,
            };
            Ok(TypedExpression::Int(ir::IntExpression::BinaryOperation(
                Box::new(left),
                op,
                Box::new(right),
            )))
        }
        _ => Err(TypeError("Operator not supported for type".to_string()))?,
    }
}
```

### Code gen

This is also very simple!
```rust
// code_gen.rs
    fn compile_int_expression(&self, expression: &ir::IntExpression) -> inkwell::values::IntValue {
        match expression {
            ir::IntExpression::Literal(int) => self.int_type().const_int(*int as u64, false),
            ir::IntExpression::Negate(expression) => {
                let expression = self.compile_int_expression(expression);
                self.builder.build_int_neg(expression, "Negate")
            }
            ir::IntExpression::BinaryOperation(left, op, right) => {
                let left = self.compile_int_expression(left);
                let right = self.compile_int_expression(right);

                match op {
                    ir::IntBinaryOp::Plus => self.builder.build_int_add(left, right, "Plus"),
                    ir::IntBinaryOp::Minus => self.builder.build_int_sub(left, right, "Minus"),
                    ir::IntBinaryOp::Multiply => {
                        self.builder.build_int_mul(left, right, "Multiply")
                    }
                    ir::IntBinaryOp::Divide => {
                        self.builder.build_int_signed_div(left, right, "Divide")
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

## Binary Operators - bools

This is going to be very similar, in fact I trust you can do it yourself! But I will give you the tests:
```
${
    assert true && true;
    assert !true && false;
    assert !false && true;
    assert !false && false;

    assert true || true;
    assert true || false;
    assert false || true;
    assert !false || false;

    assert 1 == 1 && 2 == 2;
    assert 1 == 1 || 2 == 0;
}
```
### Parsing

Then you will add tokens for `AndAnd` and `OrOr` (and also `And` and `Or`, but we wont use those yet!)

We also add the `And` and `Or` tokens to the AST, and then we add them to the `OPERATORS` static:
```rust
lazy_static! {
    static ref OPERATORS: Vec<OperatorType> = vec![
        OperatorType::Prefix(TokenType::Bang, ast::PrefixOp::Not),
        OperatorType::Binary(vec![
            (TokenType::AndAnd, ast::BinaryOp::And),
            (TokenType::OrOr, ast::BinaryOp::Or)
        ]),
        OperatorType::Comparison(vec![
            // ...
        ]),
        // ...
    ];
}
```
### Ir 

The ir modification is the same as with the int, and same for the type resolution! You should be able to figure those out yourself!

### Code gen

Now, we need to decide wether we want short-circuit or not, what do I mean with this? If say we had `true | ...` the right hand side wont get executed if we short-circuit, because we already know the result will be true! But if we dont short-circuit it will get executed, and then we will check the result. 

Short-circuits require more work because we need to check the result of the left side and then decide wether to execute the right side or not. And this gets tricky, because you might model this as:
```rust
let mut result = ...;
if !left {
    result = right;
} else {
    result = true;
}

```
But there is an issue, we cant just create code like this in LLVM! Why? well in LLVM every var is immutable, so we cant just assign to the same value in multiple locations :O 

What will we do? We will allocate the value on the stack and store a reference to it, this isnt like a normal pointer, it is a abstract idea in LLVM land. So it might actually look like:
```rust
let pointer = allocate();
if !left {
    store(pointer, right);
} else {
    store(pointer, true);
}
let result = load(pointer)
```
This is a bit annoying, but it is the only way to do it. We will do that same thing when we add variables later. And ofc LLVM will optimize away this check if the result is clear and so on, like if you did `true || x` it will be optimized to just `x`!

Okay lets describe the short-circuits in detail, we will use truth tables to see this clearly. 

| Left  | Right | And   | Or    |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| True  | True  | True  | True  |
| True  | False | False | True  |
| False | True  | False | True  |
| False | False | False | False |

So `or` and `and` are kinda opposites, for `or` if the left side is `false` then the result is the right side, and for `and` if the left side is `true` then the result is the right side.

We also have to consider what the result is when we do short circuit, for `and` it is `false` and for `or` it is `true`!

Lets implement both of these:
```rust
            ir::BooleanExpression::Operator(left, op, right) => {
                let left = self.compile_bool_expression(left);

                let current_block = self.builder.get_insert_block().unwrap();
                let right_block = self
                    .context
                    .insert_basic_block_after(current_block, "right_block");
                let short_block = self
                    .context
                    .insert_basic_block_after(right_block, "short_block");
                let continue_block = self
                    .context
                    .insert_basic_block_after(short_block, "continue_block");

                let pointer = self
                    .builder
                    .build_alloca(self.context.bool_type(), "pointer");

                match op {
                    ir::BooleanOperator::And => {
                        self.builder
                            .build_conditional_branch(left, right_block, short_block);
                    }
                    ir::BooleanOperator::Or => {
                        self.builder
                            .build_conditional_branch(left, short_block, right_block);
                    }
                }

                self.builder.position_at_end(right_block);
                let right = self.compile_bool_expression(right);
                self.builder.build_store(pointer, right);
                self.builder.build_unconditional_branch(continue_block);

                self.builder.position_at_end(short_block);
                let short_result = match op {
                    ir::BooleanOperator::And => self.context.bool_type().const_int(0, false),
                    ir::BooleanOperator::Or => self.context.bool_type().const_int(1, false),
                };
                self.builder.build_store(pointer, short_result);
                self.builder.build_unconditional_branch(continue_block);

                self.builder.position_at_end(continue_block);
                self.builder
                    .build_load(self.context.bool_type(), pointer, "result")
                    .into_int_value()
            }
```

First we compile the left side, then we create our blocks, we need one for the right hand case, one for the short-circuit case, and ofc one for the continue after the check.

We then create the allocated "pointer", and then we create the branch based on the operator type, you might have expected to see a `not` in there, but we can just swap the branches and we get the same effect.

Then in the right hand side block we compile the right hand side, and then we store it in the pointer, and then we jump to the continue block.

Similar in the short block we decide what the result should be and then we store that in the pointer, and then we jump to the continue block.

In the continue block we load our value! 

## Groups

Now lets add groups, i.e parenthesis, this lets us "break" precedence, `(1 + 2) * 3`, The code thing is that this is totally in the parsing stage, we dont even have to touch the AST! Because the ast already encodes the precedence, so we just need to change the parsing logic! 

but first... TESTS!
```
${
    assert (1 + 2) * 3 == 9;
    assert ((((((((5)))))))) == 5;
    assert -(2) == -2;
    assert -(1 + 2) == -3;
}
```

### Parsing

But we do have to add new tokens, `(` and `)`!
```rust
// parsing/parser.rs
    fn group(&mut self) -> anyhow::Result<ast::Expression> {
        if self.peek()? == &TokenType::ParenOpen {
            self.0.void();
            let expression = self.expression()?;
            self.expect(TokenType::ParenClose)?;
            Ok(expression)
        } else {
            Ok(ast::Expression::Literal(self.literal()?))
        }
    }

    fn expression_precedence(&mut self, precedence: usize) -> anyhow::Result<ast::Expression> {
        let level = match OPERATORS.get(precedence) {
            Some(level) => level,
            None => return self.group(),
        };
        // ...
    }
```

And it was that easy.

## Conclusion

We now have operators, so basically we got a very overgrown calculator! Yay! Now we can start adding more fun stuff, like variables, control flow, functions, etc.
